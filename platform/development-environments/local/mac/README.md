## 1. **Introduction**

This guide will walk you through setting up a local developer environment on a MacOS device. It provides instructions on how to install Homebrew, asdf version manager, IntelliJ IDEA, JavaSDK, and Gradle. In addition, it provides links on how to set up a development environment with using either the Launch platform container, a local developer container, or utilizing local build methods. 

## 2. Prerequisites:
1. MacOS 14.6+ M1.
2. User has rights to install softwares and change permissions as required on their machine.

## 3. Tool Installation

### 3.1 Homebrew

1. Open Terminal.

</p>

### 3.2 asdf

1. Open Terminal.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./pictures/3.2-asdf-terminal-01.png" /> 
</p>

2. Install `asdf` by running the following commands:

    ```sh
    $ brew install coreutils curl git
    $ brew install asdf
    ```

<p align="center">
  <img src="./pictures/3.2-asdf-install-01.png" /> 
</p>

3. Add `asdf` to your shell by running the following commands:

    ```sh
    $ echo -e "\n. $(brew --prefix asdf)/libexec/asdf.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
    $ source ~/.zshrc
    ```

<p align="center">
  <img src="./pictures/3.2-asdf-shell-01.png" /> 
</p>

4. Verify the installation by running:

    ```sh
    asdf --version
    ```

<p align="center">
  <img src="./pictures/3.2-asdf-version-01.png" /> 
</p>

### 3.3 IntelliJ IDEA
1. [Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=mac) Intellij

<p align="center">
  <img src="./pictures/3.3-intellij-download-01.png" /> 
</p>

2. Run the installer, specify path for installation

<p align="center">
  <img src="./pictures/3.3-intellij-install-01.png" /> 
</p>

3. Open the IDE, select the JDK path in your project structure.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./pictures/3.3-intellij-open-01.png" /> 
</p>

Within IntelliJ enable support for the following builder tools:
####  <u>Java JDK</u>

- Open Intellij IDE
- Click on Menu -> Project Structure -> SDKs -> Click folder icon next to JDK home path -> Download JDK
- Select Amazon Corretto 17. Click Download
- Launch up Terminal. Type in the command "java â€“version". If it does not work, go to the troubleshooting section.
- Run the command in terminal to set JAVA_HOME "export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/amazon-corretto-17.jdk/Contents/Home"
- Add the jdk/bin path to system path variable PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

#### TroubleShooting JDK Installation
- Check if there are any pre-existing Java installs. Uninstall them and reinstall again
- Temporarily turn off firewalls and antivirus software.
- If you get file corrupt message, download the installation file again.
- Ensure you are making use of the right java download.

####  <u>Gradle</u>
- Intellij IDE has in built Gradle support
- Settings ->Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle
- select the installed JDK version under Gradle JVM

### 3.4 Docker

1. [Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) Mac Docker Desktop

<p align="center">
  <img src="./pictures/3.4-docker-download-01.png" /> 
</p>

2. Run the installer

<p align="center">
  <img src="./pictures/3.4-docker-install-01.png" /> 
</p>

3. Open the Docker Desktop application. All the containers running will be shown in the dashboard.

## 4 Development Environment

A developer has a few different options to build and test their application. This section provides different options and they do not need to perform each step. 

### 4.1 Platform Container
### 4.2 Local Dev Container
### 4.3 LCAF

Launch Common Automation Framework (LCAF) offers standard set of commands to build/test/deploy applications written in different programming languages and architectures. It is achieved with help of `make` commands. The set of commands described below explain the process of building the docker image for the java application, starting the application locally, bringing it down and pushing the image to the remote repository.

#### `make` commands:

#### Pre-requisits for running the `make` commands
1. User should have access to Elastic Container Registry (ECR), in AWS cloud to push/pull the images.
2. Login to AWS environment using terminal where rest of the `make` commands will be executed. `<aws profile name>` is the name of the aws profile that user has created for `sso login`
```sh
$ aws sso login --profile `<aws profile name>`
```
3. Export the profile as environment variable
```sh 
$ export AWS_PROFILE=`<aws profile name>`
```
#### Make commands
1. make configure
   This command uses `git repo` tool to fetch dependent repositories which store the code for underlining commands to run `make` commands mentioned below. `make configure` pulls `lcaf-component-container` repository which stores the code for underlining `make` commands.

2. make docker/check-env-vars
   `CONTAINER_REGISTRY, CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME, CONTAINER_IMAGE_VERSION` variables are stored in `Makefile.includes` file. The values of these variables can be changed so we customize the image name, version number and container registry name. The `make` commands ensures these values are present. This command does validation check.

3. make docker/build
   This command builds the image using `Dockerfile`

4. make docker_compose/start
   This command runs `docker-compose up` command to start the application locally.

5. make docker_compose/stop
   This command runs `docker-compose up` command to stop the application locally.

6. make docker/aws_ecr_login
   This commands obtains authentication token to login to CONTAINER_REGISTRY in AWS cloud so that docker image can be pushed to the registry.

7. make docker/push
   This command builds and pushes the image to the container registry.

### 4.4 Local build

## Build the application
1. Run the application in docker with postgres
    - `docker build . -t launch-api:s1`
    - `docker-compose up`: Create and start containers defined in a Docker Compose file.
    - `docker-compose down`: Stop and remove containers defined in a Docker Compose file.
    - use PgAdmin service to view the table & daa: http://localhost:5050/browser
        - https://medium.com/@marvinjungre/get-postgresql-and-pgadmin-4-up-and-running-with-docker-4a8d81048aea
    1. If you are using H2 database you can connect to the H2 console: http://localhost:8087/h2-console (no password needed, just click "Connect").
3. Connect to the actuator with the credentials "test/test": http://localhost:8087/actuator
4. Open the API Docs: http://localhost:8087/swagger-ui.html

## Contract testing with Pact
- the contact files are created when the consumer pact tests are run & can be found under the build/pacts.
- run `docker-compose up` to start the pact broker.
- run `./gradlew pactPublish` to push the contract to the broker.

# For Platform Engineers
Platform engineers who would like to run the application locally (without having to make the code changes), can set up `docker` on their machines to build/deploy applications.
