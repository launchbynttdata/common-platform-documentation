# Repository Naming Schemes

This document serves as an entrypoint to our repository naming schemes. Follow the links below to dig into a specific type of repository.

## Platform

Components for LCAF, the Launch Common Automation Framework, should follow the [Platform Component Naming Scheme](naming-schemes/lcaf-component-names.md).

## IaC Naming

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) repositories (currently Helm, Terraform, and Terragrunt) should follow the [Infrastructure as Code Git Repository Naming Scheme](naming-schemes/iac-repository-names.md).

## Python Naming

Reusable Python scripts, CLI applications, and web applications should follow the [Python Component Naming Scheme](naming-schemes/python-component-names.md)

## Sample Applications

We rely on Sample Applications to serve as examples and to exercise platform components. Sample Applications that are maintained by the Platform team should follow the [Platform Sample Applications Naming Scheme](naming-schemes/platform-sample-applications.md).
