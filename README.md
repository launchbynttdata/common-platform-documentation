This repository is a knowledge base repository containing information related to, and associated with, the `Launch` platform.

It streamlines the creation and management of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform and Terragrunt, and automates deployments through secure efficient pipelines. The `Launch` platform integrates with your SCM of choice utilizing webhooks and allows you to utilize the platform on a variety of cloud providers. The `launch-cli` tool enables local repository creation and lifecycle management of your service.
