## Single Purpose Repository Principle

### Principle Overview
This principle advocates for a [poly-repository (poly-repo) strategy](../strategies/poly-git-repo-strategy.md) where each repository is dedicated to producing a single, environment-agnostic code artifact that serves a specific purpose. The principle emphasizes that each repository should be capable of undergoing the complete software development lifecycle - from development through to building, testing, deployment, and feature release - in isolation.

Key aspects of this principle include:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each repository should focus on a single functionality or service, aligning with the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle) by Robert C. Martin. This principle applies broadly to various software components, including but not limited to microservices, microsites, functions, and APIs.
- **Environment Agnosticism**: The code artifact produced should be operable in any environment, ensuring flexibility and scalability.
- **Independent Lifecycle Management**: Each repository should independently manage its development, build, test, deployment, and feature release processes.
- **Isolation**: Changes in one repository should not directly affect or require changes in other repositories, promoting modular development and easier maintenance.
- **Autonomy**: Each repository operates autonomously, allowing for faster iterations and more focused development efforts.

### Implementation
In practice, this principle supports the development of diverse application types managed in individual repositories. This facilitates independent scaling, easier updates, and quicker adaptation to changes, aligning with agile and DevOps methodologies.

### Benefits
- Facilitates continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes.
- Enhances scalability and maintainability of the codebase.
- Encourages focused and efficient development practices.

This principle is particularly effective in large-scale projects where multiple teams work on different aspects of the application, ensuring coherence and consistency in development practices across the organization.
